# Our Money v4 — working notes

Private household finance app for a couple in Dubai. See `PLAN.md` for the
product plan, data model and decisions log. This file is for the operational
things that are easy to get wrong.

## Deploys cost real money — batch them

Netlify is on the **free tier: 300 build minutes/month, resetting on the 20th**.
Every push to the production branch triggers a build.

- Verify locally first (`npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`), then push
  **once** with the work batched. Don't push per-commit while iterating.
- Check that Netlify's branch-deploy setting is "production branch only" — if
  it's set to all branches, every push to every branch burns minutes.
- Edge Function deploys go through Supabase, not Netlify, and cost nothing here.
  Backend-only changes never need a Netlify build.

## Screens

10 nav tabs: Home, Accounts, Investments, Transactions, Reports, Budget, Recurring,
Goals, Debts, Settings. Investments and Debts were split out of Accounts and Goals
respectively once real data made the combined screens too crowded; Reports (was Cash
Flow) gained Cash Flow/Spending/Income sub-tabs and leads with a Sankey diagram. Dark
mode and a global AED/USD/INR currency toggle apply across all of them — both
device-local (localStorage via `PrefsContext`), not synced between Shrey's and
Tarika's devices on purpose. See `PLAN.md` for the full per-screen breakdown.

## Open items (as of 9 Aug 2026, verified against live DB/deploy)

- **`refresh-prices` has never completed a successful run.** The Edge Function
  is deployed (version 2) and the button is live on Accounts → Investments,
  but every observed invocation so far failed. The first bug — it rejected the
  browser's CORS preflight with 405, so the POST never fired — is fixed and
  redeployed; nothing has been run since. Check
  `get_logs(service='edge-function')` before assuming it works. Two tickers are
  unproven against Yahoo in particular: `SKHY` (an ADR) and any future NSE
  symbol.
- **Zero transactions logged in production, ever** — not one, manual or
  Telegram. Receipt-photo accuracy is unproven; text intake works end to end
  but no real photograph has been through the pipeline yet. Note this is now
  the *only* major table still empty: accounts, recurring, budgets, goals and
  goal_contributions all carry real data. See the tuning pass in the function
  README.
- **The Telegram webhook secret is unset — and as of 10 Aug this is a blocker,
  not a tolerated gap.** The function skips the header check (it logs a warning),
  so the household allowlist is the only gate — and that allowlist reads
  `message.from.id` straight out of the *request body*. Anyone who guesses the
  URL can forge it. Today that means injecting junk transactions; once the bot
  answers questions (bot-expansion Sprint 2), the same forged request with
  `chat.id` pointed elsewhere makes it a read endpoint for the whole household's
  finances. Restoring it means setting `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Supabase
  *and* re-running `setWebhook` with the identical string, in one sitting — a
  mismatch is silent apart from 403s in the function log. Needs the bot token
  and Supabase dashboard/Management-API access no available tool exposes.
  **Blocks Taskiv #50 onward.** (Taskiv #22)
- **FIRE assumptions in Settings are dead.** `fire_swr`/`fire_return` are set,
  `fire_expense` is null, and nothing in `src/` reads any `fire_*` key — no
  screen calculates or shows a FIRE number. Deliberately not built (Shrey
  hasn't given a real monthly-expense figure yet). (Taskiv #21)
- **Supabase Auth: leaked-password protection is disabled** (security
  advisor WARN). Cheap toggle, but no tool in this session's Supabase MCP
  reaches Auth config — needs the dashboard. (Taskiv #23)
- **BTC (0.00679402) is untracked.** It sits outside the Wio portfolio view,
  so it needs its own source before it can be entered.
- **`pg_cron` and `pg_net` are available but not installed** on `our-rokda`
  (verified 10 Aug via `list_extensions`). Both are needed for scheduled
  Telegram pushes and install with `create extension`. (Taskiv #68)

Resolved since the last pass — **Taskiv #44 is fixed**: `intake.ts` now resolves
"today" via `_shared/dates.ts`'s `todayInTz` (Asia/Dubai via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`,
not a UTC string slice). **Bot-expansion Sprint 1 foundations are also in**:
`015_bot_expansion.sql` is applied to `our-rokda` — `transactions.deleted_at` for
soft-delete-based `/undo`, and a `notifications` table with a unique `dedupe_key`
so the future hourly push cron is idempotent (verified live: a duplicate
`dedupe_key` insert throws `23505`). `store.ts`/`telegram.ts`/`types.ts` moved to
`supabase/functions/_shared/` so `telegram-push` can reuse them without depending
on `telegram-intake`'s config. `src/lib/transactions.js` reads now filter out
soft-deleted rows.

**task #6 is done**. Real data is in production:
41 investment holdings (25 Zerodha India equities, 8 Shrey US/gold, 8 Tarika
US/metals), 4 liability accounts (ENBD car loan, 2 ENBD Noon CC EMIs, FAB 0%
cash advance), all recurring bills and salaries, 12 budget limits and 6 goals.
Every portfolio reconciles to its source statement. The 3 pay-down goals are
seeded (`012_seed_paydown_goals.sql`) and now linked to real liability accounts.

**Money data comes from broker screenshots, never from a web price lookup or a
verbally-quoted figure.** Both alternatives were tried this session and both
introduced real error — web prices were ~$600 out across two tickers, and two
separately-typed average prices were wrong. Neither would have surfaced as a
visible bug; they would just have made net worth quietly incorrect.

## Branches

`main` is the trunk and holds Epics 1–7 plus the Monarch-parity backlog
(#20, #25–33). Netlify's production branch points at `main` and deploys on
push — confirmed via the live deploy record matching `main`'s HEAD commit.
Put `[skip netlify]` in the commit message for docs-only changes so they
don't burn a production build.

## Supabase

Project `our-rokda` (`wrxqgfbolryveivgdjia`).

- Schema lives in `supabase/schema/NNN_*.sql`, applied in order. Additive-only,
  never destructive — this database carries real money data.
- `001`–`007` were run by hand in the SQL Editor so they don't appear in
  `supabase migration list`; `008`+ do.
- The `telegram-intake` Edge Function is deployed straight from
  `supabase/functions/telegram-intake/`. Keep the deployed copy in sync with the
  repo — after deploying, diff the two.
- `refresh-prices` is the second Edge Function: manually triggered from the
  Investments view, fetches US stock/ETF prices from Yahoo's unofficial chart
  endpoint and BTC from CoinGecko (both keyless), and writes `last_price`/
  `value` back. It only touches accounts with `type='investment'`,
  `currency='USD'` and a non-null `ticker` + `quantity`; metals and the India
  equities are excluded by having no ticker, on purpose. Because it is called
  **from a browser** it must answer the CORS preflight — the OPTIONS handler is
  load-bearing, unlike in `telegram-intake`.

## Tests

```bash
npm test              # Edge Function tests: node --test, no network, no keys
npm run demo:telegram # walks the Telegram flow against mocked payloads
```

There are no frontend tests yet. `npm run build` is the only check the React
side gets.

## Telegram bot expansion (designed 10 Aug 2026, not yet built)

Two design docs, both binding on the implementation:

- `docs/telegram-bot-expansion.md` — architecture: the intent router, the query
  toolbox, propose-then-tap writes, the push function.
- `docs/telegram-bot-sprint-plan.md` — feature-by-feature feasibility against the
  live schema, cost analysis, the four settled decisions (§6), and the migration
  numbering ledger (§4b).

Backlog is in Taskiv as epics 8–13, tasks **#44–79**. Four rules from that design
that are easy to violate later and expensive to undo:

1. **The model never writes SQL and never does arithmetic.** It picks one entry
   from a closed query enum; Postgres computes every digit. The function holds
   the service-role key, so text-to-SQL here has an unbounded blast radius.
2. **The router defaults to "spend" on any doubt.** A misrouted question costs an
   `/undo`; a misrouted spend is money that never enters the ledger.
3. **Transactions keep write-then-flag; every other write is propose-then-tap.**
   The "never lose a spend" rule justifies optimistic writes only for
   transactions — nobody forgets moving 2,000 AED into a goal, and a bad
   `accounts.value` write corrupts `nw_daily` permanently.
4. **The bot never writes `quantity`/`avg_cost`/`last_price`.** A typed stock buy
   logs a cash outflow only; holdings stay screenshot-sourced. See the money-data
   rule above — this is the same rule, applied to chat.

Push alerts need no model call at all: SQL computes the number, a template writes
the sentence. Whole expansion costs under $0.50/month in API spend; the binding
constraint is alert volume, because the bot pushes into the same chat intake uses
and **a muted bot is a broken intake pipeline.**

## Telegram intake

Setup, troubleshooting and the receipt-tuning pass are documented in
`supabase/functions/telegram-intake/README.md`. Two things that cost hours once:

- Group privacy must be **off in BotFather**, and the bot must be **removed and
  re-added** to any group it had already joined — the setting doesn't apply
  retroactively, and the symptom is that `/commands` arrive but plain messages
  silently don't.
- HTTP header values are Latin-1 only. A single non-ASCII character (an em dash)
  in an outgoing header makes Deno throw while constructing the request, so the
  call never leaves the function and the upstream API records nothing.
